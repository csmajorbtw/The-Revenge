# The-Revenge

Just a few tips:

1. Click on "Next" or "Previous" etc. instead of clicking the space bar or the
enter key, because clicking 'enter' or 'space' when you should be manually
clicking on them instead might break the game.

2. Follow the directions. (Simple)

3. Don't exit the tab or you will have to restart. (No saves)

4. In the beginning, put the game in full screen.

5. Put "The Revenge" folder directly in your desktop and not in any other folder.

~That's about it
